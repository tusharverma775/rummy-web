Templates are compiled to PHP and cached, giving great performance and taking advantage of PHP accelerators.

PHPTAL by default ensures well-formed output and escapes XML-unsafe characters everywhere, which means that your pages can be completely safe against HTML-injection (XSS) without great effort.

Additional features:
 • fine-grained caching of output, 
 • pre- and post- filters, 
 • internationalization via gettext or custom backend, 
 • creation of custom template attributes and expressions, 
 • templates loaded from non-standard sources (e.g. database), 
 • supports UTF-8 well, 
 • is easy to integrate and redistribute with PHP frameworks and applications.
